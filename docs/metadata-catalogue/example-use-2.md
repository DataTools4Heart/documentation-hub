## 1. Introduction

The **DataTools4Heart Catalogue** is an AI-ready cardiology dataset discovery portal based on the **Mica (OBiBa)** platform.  
It provides public access to study metadata, dataset descriptions, variables, and access request procedures.
It does **not** host raw individual-level data; rather, it provides metadata, summary statistics and information on how to gain access

This manual explains how to navigate the **public-facing** sections of the catalogue.

## 2. Homepage

When you access the website, the homepage introduces the catalogue and provides the main navigation menu.

**Screenshot Placeholder:**  
`![Homepage](images/homepage.png)`

The landing page shows a top navigation menu with:
- A search bar (“Search networks, studies, datasets and variables …”) to type keywords. 
- Quick links to Individual Studies, Collected Datasets, Variables.

Also a brief description of the  catalogue content with some statistics, like the number of variables or datasets.

## 3. Main Navigation Overview

The top navigation bar usually contains links such as:
- **Home**
- **Repository**
- **Data Access Process**
- Other informational pages (About, Contact, etc.)

### 4.2 Individual Studies

Clicking on *Individual Studies* displays a list of cardiology-related studies.

**Screenshot Placeholder:**  
`![Studies List](images/studies_list.png)`

Each study entry usually shows:
- Study title
- Brief description
- Metadata or links to datasets

You can click on any study to see more details.

---

### 4.3 Study Detail Page

A public study page typically includes:
- Description
- Objectives
- Institutions or data owners
- Datasets linked to that study

---

### 4.4 Datasets

Under *Collected Datasets*, you can view a public list of available dataset descriptions.

**Screenshot Placeholder:**  
`![Datasets List](images/datasets_list.png)`

Information may include:
- Dataset title
- Associated study
- Brief overview

---

### 4.5 Variables

The *Variables* section allows public browsing of variable names and limited metadata.

**Screenshot Placeholder:**  
`![Variables List](images/variables_list.png)`

Users can typically see:
- Variable label/name
- Source (study/dataset)
- Data type or category (if displayed publicly)

---

## 5. Search Functionality

The catalogue includes a global search bar or a dedicated search page. You can search studies, datasets, or variables by keywords.

**Screenshot Placeholder:**  
`![Search Page](images/search_page.png)`

---

## 6. Data Access Process (Public View)

A dedicated page explains:
- Steps to request data
- Eligibility or governance structure
- Policies and conditions

**Screenshot Placeholder:**  
`![Data Access Process](images/data_access_process.png)`

As a public user, you can read the procedures before any account-based actions.

---

## 7. Approved Projects (Public View)

Some catalogues display a public list of projects that have already obtained data access.

**Screenshot Placeholder:**  
`![Approved Projects](images/approved_projects.png)`

This section may include:
- Project title
- Lead institution
- Summary or objectives

---

## 8. Tips for Navigation

- Use the main menu to switch quickly between sections.
- Explore the Repository first to understand the scope of cardiology datasets.
- Use keywords in the search bar to find relevant studies or variables quickly.
- Public view generally does **not** allow data downloads or detailed variable inspection.
